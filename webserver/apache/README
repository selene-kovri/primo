This is an Apache module that allows users to pay for access using Monero mining.
You can allow access to any part of your website against Monero mining.
You can also offer the user an optional ad-free page if the user mines.


Build with:

  apxs  -a -c mod_primo.c cJSON/cJSON*.c


Install with:

  sudo cp .libs/mod_primo.so /etc/httpd/modules/
  sudo cp 12.primo.conf /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/12.primo.conf


Edit the Apache configuration:

  sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/12.primo.conf

    PrimoMoneroHost is the URL where your Monero dameon is listening for RPC connections. That particular port should not be accessible from the outside.
    PrimoMiningPage is the URL where mod_primo will be listening to user requests, it can be anything you like, as long as this file is within one of the locations controlled by mod_primo (see below for locations information).
    PrimoName is the name of your website, which the users should see.
    PrimoPassthrough lets Apache continue serving the request anyway if the user's balance is not enough after adding a "X-Primo-Unpaid: 1" header to the response (Apache may choose to include ads only if this header is set, for example)

  sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

    Add a location for every section of your website you want to be controlled by mod_primo:

    <Location "/primo/">
      SetHandler primo-handler
      PrimoCost 1
    </Location>
    <Location "/primo/premium/">
      SetHandler primo-handler
      PrimoCost 2
    </Location>

    Here, "/primo" means that any URL on your website in /primo/ will be controlled by mod_primo.
    PrimoCost is how many credits are required to access any resource in this location.
    You can specify any number of such locations, with different costs for each, but they
    should all be contained within a main location.
    You should ensure that the URL specified in PrimoMiningPage is within such a location.


Restart Apache (for sytemd):

  sudo systemctl restart httpd



The user will have to be running the Primo client software to be able to pay this way.
If the user is not running this software, or if the user does not have enough balance
to pay their way, the request wil be denied with error 402 (payment required).


mod_primo expects the following headers on requests:

  X-Primo-Signature: a signature from a user authenticating the request
  X-Primo-Nonce: data from a miner claiming new credits
  X-Primo-TopHash: top hash the miner mined on when sending a nonce
  X-Primo-Cookie: Value the miner received along with the hashing blob it's mining on

mod_primo adds the following headers on responses:

  X-Primo-Payment: the credit cost for the resource
  X-Primo-MiningPage: the URL to the mining page set up in the configuration
  X-Primo-Credits: the user's current credit balance
  X-Primo-Unpaid: set if the user's balance is not enough and PrimoPassthrough is set in the configuration

  X-Primo-Name: the name of your website as set up in the configuration (mining page only)
  X-Primo-Location: the path on your website where the pay-for-access applies
  X-Primo-Difficulty: the mining difficulty (mining page only)
  X-Primo-CreditsPerHashFound: how many credits are awarded for a succesful find while mining (mining page only)
  X-Primo-Height: the current height of the Monero blockchain (mining page only)
  X-Primo-TopHash: the hash for the top block on the Monero blockchain (mining page only)
  X-Primo-HashingBlob: the mining data for miners to use (mining page only)
  X-Primo-Cookie: a value the miner should send back when sending a nonce
