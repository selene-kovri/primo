This is the Primo control center.

Primo offers a user interface to mine Monero to the user's choice of websites
according to information relayed to it by browser extensions.


 * BUILDING

Primo uses Qt/QML, and will need basic Qt/QML widgets. It also needs boost.

Build with these commands:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  qmake .. # might be named qmake-qt5
  make

When built, you should copy the native messaging file to your browser's directory:

cp primo.control.center.json ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts

The Primo Firefox extension (installed separately) will now be able to communicate
with the Primo control center.


 * PROTOCOL DOCUMENTATION
